# S3 Logger

This tool write logs to an S3 bucket. It will create an SNS Topic and SQS Queue, poll messages from SQS, and then write the logs elegantly to the S3 every minute. The deployment method leverages CloudFormation and is customizable using the available parameters. It is recommended to deploy two stacks, to segregate Dome9 Audit Trail and Compliance Results into separate folders.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running in an AWS Account for testing and development.

### Prerequisites

The following cloud assets and conditions are prerequisites to the deployment

* S3 Bucket for Logging before deploying the CloudFormation template.

### Installation

Click the link below to deploy this stack. The AWS region last logged into will be the region of deployment.
> Note: If you plan to use this tool for both Dome9 Compliance findings and Audit trail events you will deploy the stack _twice_ and then configure the S3 bucket, folder names, and log file prefix accordingly. The SNS topic (InputTopicARN) created from each CFT deployment is intended to be mapped to specific use case (see below) of Compliance or Audit. 

The stack has five parameters

**queueUrl** - the SQS queue which recieves messages from SNS (auto-populated from CFT)

**S3BucketForLogging** - this is the S3 bucket

**LogFolder** - path in the S3 bucket for the log files

**LogFilePrefix** - a prefix for the log files, to identify them

**isGzipEnabled** - enables gzip compression and file extension

## Post-Install - Configure Dome9 to send events to the new SNS Topic

### Verify Lambda Execution Role Permissions
* Ensure the Lambda Execution role has permissions to put objects in the S3 bucket specified during the CloudFormation deployment. This is done automatically during CFT deployment, however changes made after deployment are not tracked.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::test/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Use Case #1: Continuous Compliance Findings
1. In CloudFormation, find the stack that was designated for Dome9 compliance results and click the **Outputs** tab. 
1. Copy the **InputTopicARN** value.
1. Log into a Dome9 account.
1. Select **Alerting and Notifications** > **Notifications**.
1. In the top-right, click  **ADD NOTIFICATION**.
1. Enter a policy **Name**.
1. Click to check **SNS notification for each new finding as soon as it is discovered**.
1. Paste the **InputTopicARN** value into the **SNS Topic ARN** field.
1. Click **SEND TEST MESSAGE**.
1. Click **SAVE**.
1. Select **Posture Management** > **Compliance Policies**.
1. In the top-right, click  **ADD POLICY** > **Cloud Account Policy**.
1. Go through the wizard to select the relevant accounts and rulesets.
1. Under **Notifications**, select the Notification policy created earlier for SNS.
1. Click **SAVE**

### Use Case #2: Dome9 Audit Trail Events
1. In CloudFormation, find the stack that was designated for Dome9 audit trail events and select the **Outputs** tab. 
1. Copy the **InputTopicARN** value.
1. Log into a Dome9 account.  
1. Click **Settings** > **Integrations**. 
1. Click the **SNS Integration** tab.
1. Click **Enable**.
1. In the pop up window, paste the **InputTopicARN** value (step 4).

## Testing
The LogIngestionLambdaFunction is scheduled to run every minute. If you would like to run manual tests configure a test event within the lambda function.
